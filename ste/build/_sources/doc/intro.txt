Sphinx Terminlogy Extension is similar to the glossary directive. The primary difference is that the terminology extension has a directive to list all the terms. The terminology extension requires the use of the `.. terminology::` directive for each term. The terminlogy extension does not support defining multiple terms with the same definition.

Directives
*****************************

The directives are::

   .. terminology:: term to define
      The definition goes here.

   .. terminologylist::

The `.. terminlogy::` directive requires at least one word and can have up to 15 words. See :ref:`moreWords` if you want a different number of words.
