Updates Desired
***************************

* We would like to add to the extension the ability to add the terms to the general index such as the way the `.. glossary::` directive does. Hence, the user would not need to remember to use the `.. index::` directive. 
* A different way to do downloads so the sde.zip is not part of the download. In other words, we are giving them two copies of the documentation and extension with the current method.
