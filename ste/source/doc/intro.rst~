Sphinx Terminlogy Extension is similar to the glossary directive. The primary difference is that the terminology extension has a directive to list all the terms. The terminology extension requires the use of the `.. terminology::` directive for each term. The terminlogy extension does not support defining multiple terms with the same definition. 

The terms are also placed in the index.

This documenation assumes you are familiar with using Sphinx. 

This extension is a modification of the example given on http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/extdev/tutorial.html. 

.. index::
   pair: directive; terminology
   pair: directive; terminologylist

The `.. terminlogy::` directive requires at least one word and can have up to 15 words. See :ref:`moreWords` if you want a different number of words.
