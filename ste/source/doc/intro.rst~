Sphinx Definition Extension is similar to the glossary directive. The primary difference is that the definition extension has a directive to list all the terms. The definition extension requires the use of the `.. definition::` directive for each term. The definition extension does not support defining multiple terms with the same definition. 

Version 1.0.1 does not place the terms in the general index. So if you want the terms in the index, you need to use the `.. index::` directive.

This documenation assumes you are familiar with using Sphinx. 

This extension is a modification of the example given on http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/extdev/tutorial.html. 

.. index::
   pair: directive; definition
   pair: directive; definitionlist

Directives
*****************************

::

   .. definition:: term to define

      The definition goes here.

.. warning::

   There needs to be a blank between the directive (and term) and the defintion.

The `.. definition::` directive requires at least one word and can have up to 15 words. See :ref:`moreWords` if you want a different number of words in the term. 

If you setup the conf.py correctly, `.. definition::` directive will place the term and defintion on your page.

::

   .. definitionlist::

The `.. definitionlist::` directive is used to place a sorted list of the terms anywhere in your documentation. For example, you might make a glossary page and include the `.. definitionlist::` directive to get a sorted list of all the terms you have defined.

.. index::
